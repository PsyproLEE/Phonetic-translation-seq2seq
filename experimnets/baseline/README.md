## Baseline Experiments

Baseline experiments apply only phonological noise
(vowel/consonant-level perturbations) with varying probabilities (0.3–1.0)
to analyze the effect of noise intensity on model robustness.

This baseline setup does not include data scaling or advanced augmentation
strategies.

In this stage, overfitting to canonical pronunciation patterns
was observed, motivating the use of stronger augmentation strategies
in subsequent experiments.
