### Data Augmentation

Pronunciation-level noise was applied to simulate realistic
Korean phonetic errors in user input.

The noise generation methods (e.g., vowel change,
phonological change) are inspired by the KoNoise project
by Wisenut Research:
https://github.com/wisenut-research/konoise

This repository does not include the original KoNoise
implementation. We use the methods only as a preprocessing
step for robustness, not as a contribution to noise modeling.
